 This is a modular, flexible client for testing probes behaviour. It
 is generic enough to be able to talk to any of the QMS sensors, and 
 can be converted to test new probes by merely editing the function in
 Payload.cpp. This client creates an intial query, and then sends a
 sequence of a pause, resume, and stop requests to the probe. It also
 generates two erroneous messages, both of them caught locally, and
 proceeds to send a malformed message to the sensor anyway, to
 demonstrate error handling at the sensor.

Remos_Instrumentation
=====================


The Remos_Instrumentation is like a glue code which talks to QMS_API 
as well as Remos. The Remos should be up and running with Bridge Collector 
and SNMP collector for this to work. As soon as Remos_Instrumentation comes up,
it performs the following functions.  

1:- 	Makes sure that Remos is running.
2:-	Talks to the "QMS_Channel"and initializes the consumer and supplier interfaces.
3:- 	Waits for a request of type bandwidth_request.
4:- 	Once the requets arrives , the call back function is called, which handles the 
	request by invoking either the graph or flow function depending on the type of 
	remos data requested.


To run Remos_Instrumentation:

	Just type in ->  Remos_Instrumentation on the command line. 

	Make sure that Naming Service and QMS_Channel are running already. This works fine,
	if the Naming Service is running on the same subnet, Otherwise use the option
	-ORBInitRef, associated with resolving the TAO Naming Service.
	
	There is also a startRemos bash script available under Remos_Instrumrntation
	directory, which can be used to start Bridge collector ,SNMP collector as well as 
	the Remos_Instrumrntation.

To build the Remos_Instrumentation:

	This is built by default , when you build the whole QMS_API stuff. But to build it
	seperately , go to the Remos_Instrumentation directory and just type "make". 
	It needs the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to point to ACE and TAO shared libraries 
	as well as libQMS_Api.so, libQMS_Remos.so .

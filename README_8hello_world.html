   </pre><p>If you have not done this already, it would be a good idea to read the section on <a class="el" href="QMSSensors.html">Understanding QMS Sensors</a> in the documentation in <a class="el" href="README_8background.html">Understanding QMS</a> before you proceed with the HelloWorld Sensor. Additionally, the section on <a class="el" href="QMSProbes.html">Understanding QMS Probes</a> is also good reading.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="HelloWorldOverview"></a>
Overview of the HelloWorld Sensor</h1>
<p>The Hello World servant is a reference implementation of a QMS Sensor that provides an example of the interactions that a sensor has with the rest of the distributed QMS infrastructure. It is a simplified implementation, since this sensor deploys no external probes, and has only a single, simple built in probe; hence only one side of the interactions of a generic sensor are exposed here.</p>
<p>Additionally, this sensor implementation demonstrates the utility of validation of the messages that flow in the QMS infrastructure by optionally providing a slightly flawed data message every 7 messages.</p>
<p>Additionally, this implementation does not implement the full synchronization mechanisms required for handling multiple, simultaneous modifiable requests; in this implementation, pausing, resuming, and stopping any request pauses, resumes, and stops all requests currently active.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="HelloWorldFunction"></a>
Functionality</h2>
<p>The HelloWorld Sensor has been defined to essentially return a "salutation" string of the form "Hello John Doe" in response to a request which sends it the name "John Doe". To support this interaction, the HelloWorld Sensor defines a request message and its corresponding response message in its schema file "helloWorld.xsd". Any client desiring to communicate with the HelloWorld Sensor must use the defined schema to communicate with the Sensor.</p>
<p>The Sensor also supports the minrepeatInterval and the minRepetitions parameters defined in the QMS Message Schema. So the client can command the Sensor to send responses to its request for a specified number of repetitions at a specified interval. Additionally, the Sensor also supports the ability for the client to pause the flow of data and to resume and terminate the flow of data.</p>
<p>The client in the test directory sends a request with the name "John
 Doe" to the HelloWorld Sensor with the specification that the response be sent out 20 times at an interval of 1 second. Additionally, the client has also been written to send out a "pause", "resume" and "stop" message in that order.</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate the message validation that occurs at either of the communication, the client also generates two incorrect requests which never get through to the Sensor. The Sensor also generates an incorrect response for every seventh response. This erroneous behaviour in both the Sensor and the client can be turned off with the #define INTRODUCE_ERROR in the Makefile.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Running_Hello_World"></a>
Running the HelloWorld sensor</h1>
<pre class="fragment"> -# If you haven't already, please read the @ref README.install  file and
    build QMS.
 -# Ensure that you are in the correct working directory
     - % cd Instrumentation/Sensors/Hello_World
 -# Before running this sensor, you need to take a few preparatory
    steps. First, you need to have a copy of the reduced QMS XML
    schema file in the current directory in order for the parser to
    parse the incoming requests. You can get this file from the
    ${QMS_TOP}/Core/XML/ directory.
     - % cp ../../../Core/XML/QMSSchemaReduced.xsd QMSSchema.xsd
     - A Schema file that describes the payload of the XML requests 
       that the sensor needs to parse is already present in this 
       directory with the name "helloWorld.xsd".
     - Next, we need a sensor configuration file, and one is already
       provided in this directory called helloWorldConfig.xml.
 -# This step is not really required, but it makes navigation a lot
    easier. Here we create a symbolic link to the object dir.
     - % ln -s ../../../build/i586-pc-linux-gnu/Instrumentation/Sensors/Hello_World objdir
 -# We are almost ready to run the Hello World sensor. However, before
    doing so, you need to read the section of the documentation in 
    @ref README.run. The main @ref README file has a 
    pointer to it. Before continuing, you also should have started
    various CORBA services including the Naming Service, Event Service
    and the Trading Service, as detailed in that file. You also must
    have a QMS Trader service running, also as described.
 -# Make sure your LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to contain the path names of
    the ACE, TAO, and Xerces libraries.
    - % LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ACE_ROOT:$TAO_ROOT:$XERCESCROOT/lib:$XALANROOT/c/lib
    - % export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    After that, we are ready to run the hello world sensor.
    - % ./objdir/hello_world -f helloWorldConfig.xml
 -# Next, we need to start running the client. The process is similar:
    We again create a symbolic link to the objdir:
    - % cd test
    - % ln -s ../../../../build/i586-pc-linux-gnu/Instrumentation/Sensors/Hello_World/test objdir
 -# Ensure that the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set correctly in this session
    as well.
 -# Then we start the hello world sample client as shown below. Note that
    this is done from the same working directory as the Sensor because
    the client also needs access to the QMSSchema.xsd and the 
    Sensor XML schema in helloWorld.xsd.
    - % ./objdir/hello_world_client

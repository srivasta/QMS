You shall need to have a working XML::DOM perl package on your machine
in order to use this script. the easiest way for doing this (assuming
you already have perl installed) is to run
 # perl -MCPAN -e shell 'install XML::DOM'

	That was all I needed to do on a RedHat Linux box (it pulled in
 lots of other perl modules as well).*

 In order to use this script, please run:
  # perl Makefile.pl
  # make
  # make test  (only works on fully POSIX compliant systems On
                NON-POSIX systems like NT, please run instead:
       	    c: perl logger_sample --event bandwidth_request t\test_log
      	    c: perl logger_sample --event bandwidth_data    t\test_log
      	    c: perl logger_sample --event desi_app_data     t\test_log
                and verify manually if the output is correct )

  	You can then run the script in this dir, or install it on your 
 machine with 

   # make install. 


	At this point, there is little documentation, but the sample
 script should serve as an example (it also has usage information; 
    # perl logger_sample --help)

*However, depending on your installation, you may need to also install
 XML::Parser, and the underlying program expat (these are available in
 the Debian distribvution of linux, but for other distributions you
 may need to download expat separately in order to get an working
 perl/XML environement.  lynx http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/)

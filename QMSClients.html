<div class="textblock"><p>A QMS Client is an entity that operates in the QMS framework and uses the services provided by QMS. There are two basic kinds of clients.</p>
<ul>
<li>Passive Clients: These clients subscribe to one or more data streams in the QMS framework. The starting, stopping or modification of those data streams is controlled by some other entity.</li>
<li>Active Clients: These clients subscribe to one or more data streams in the QMS framework and actively send out requests to the data stream providers that start, stop or perform other control actions as supported by the data stream probe's schema.</li>
</ul>
<p>In its most basic form, a QMS client undertakes the following actions in order to obtain the services it needs. It identifies a specific QMSUniqueName for the data stream that it is interested in. This can be done through mutual understanding between the data provider and the client developer or by browsing the active offers in the QMS Trader.</p>
<p>The Client then queries the QMSTrader for all offers that provide the specific data stream (QMSUniqueName) that it is interested in. It may receive multiple offers because there may be multiple Sensors providing data streams for that specific QMSUniqueName. The client can then choose to further narrow the list of offers by using other criteria that are present in the offer. Additionally, the client can also ping the Sensor on its Command and Control interface, to determine if the Sensor that created the offer is actually available. Once an offer is selected, the client reads the offer to determine what parameters it needs to set and then it connects to the Event Channel as a consumer to start consuming the appropriate data.</p>
<p>If the client is an Active Client, then the behavior is slightly different. Since the client will be sending out requests for data, it first obtains a SupplierID from the QMS Trader. This will enable it to publish requests in QMS. After finding the offer that it is interested in, the client then makes the appropriate connection to the Event Channel and sends out its request.</p>
<p>Now as the data provider starts publishing the data, the Client will receive all the messages that it is subscribed to. Active clients can also send out requests which start/stop the data flow as well as change the interval of their delivery.</p>

 </pre><p>To use QMS, perform the following sequence of steps.</p>
<p>Start up the various CORBA services including the Naming Service, Event Service and the Trading Service. </p><pre class="fragment">- Set the ACE_ROOT environment variable to the root of your ACE/TAO
  installation.
- Run "Utilities/Scripts/corba_svc start". This will start multiple
  copies of the Event Channel with the default names in addition to 
  the Naming Service and the Trading Service.
</pre><p>Start the additional QMS Trader components. </p><pre class="fragment">- Edit Core/Trader/Trader.config to reflect your installation. 
  The format specifies the Event Channel Name, the event type and 
  whether that is the "announce", "data" or "request" channel for every
  QMSUniqueName/Category.
- Follow the instructions in the @ref README.Trader file found in the 
  directory Core/Trader to start the QMS Trader components. The output
  will reflect the QMSUniqueName/Category entries already
  defined in the environment. All new entries will be
  dynamically allocated by the QMS Trader.
- Verify that the information in the QMS Trader is accurate by 
  running ListOffers utility for the EC_INFO Service Type as
  described in the Core/Trader/README file. Also run
  ListOffers to verify the YP Offer registered by the
  QMS_Trader_ECInfo citizen. 
</pre><p>Now that the QMS infrastructure is operational, the rest of the QMS functionality can be exercised by activing a set of Sensors with their corresponding probes to supply data. Subsequently activate the client programs in the test subdirectories to query the Sensors, or activate the Simple_Logger plugin to record data.</p>
<p>Read the documentation on each Sensor for instructions on how to activate and test the appropriate Sensors/Probes and their specialized functionality.</p>
<p>As a general rule however, here is a description of what you would need to do to activate a Sensor and its probes. </p><pre class="fragment"> - Pick the sensor that you are going to use. The Generic
   Sensor is the most flexible Sensor and possibly what you
   need.
 - Pick the probes that you wish the Sensor to have the
   ability to activate. For example, the Linux_Perf_Mon probe
   which will give you system level information on a Linux
   host.
 - Edit the Sensor's configuration file to have the right
   information reflected in it. The Sensor directory already
   has a sample configuration file in it.
 - If the Sensor has external probes, then it also needs a
   Capability file that describes the probes. You can
   construct a capability file by concatenating all the sample
   capability file fragments that exist in the probe
   directories. Only use the file fragments for the probes
   that you want. Edit the capability files so that they truly
   reflect your environment. Note that this capability file
   name should be the one you refer to while editing the
   Config file in the previous step.
 - Make sure that all the XML schema file and the XSL
   transform files that are relevant for the Sensor and all
   the probes are available in the Sensor's operating
   directory. At the very minimum, you need QMSSchema.xsd and
   QMSMessage.xsl. Note that since the C++ version of Xerces
   does not support the complete XML Schema implementation,
   you should use QMSSchemaReduced.xsd instead, until this
   limitation in Xerces is fixed.
 - Start the Sensor with the argument that points to the
   configuration file.
    - ./Generic_Sensor -f genericSensorConfig.xml
 - If all goes well, the Sensor will parse its configuration
   files and register with the Trader. You can verify the
   Probe offers in the Trader using the ListOffers tool.
 - If the Sensor fails to start, verify the following.
   - The CORBA Name Service, Trader Service and the Event
     Channels with the names you are using are up and running.
   - The QMS Trader is up and running with the right seed
     information in Trader.config.
   - There are no XML parse errors in your Configuration and
     Capability files. Use the standard Xerces tools to
     verify that the XML files are well-formed and valid.
   - All the schema files needed exist in the Sensor's
     operating directory.
   - Check all of the above again, because at this point we
     don't know what else to tell you, because it should work.
 - If at any point the Sensor crashes after making valid
   offers in the QMS Trader and you notice strange behaviour
   for subsequent instances of the Sensor, restart the QMS
   Trader and the CORBA Trading Service. This should bring you
   back to a pristine QMS environment.

    <p>
      A flow sequence of the scenario is sketched out below. It should
      be noted that QMS presents a uniform (symmetrical) API to either
      side of the transaction. 
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
	The client code (Desi or the Remos instrumentation)
	instantiates a <a href="QMS_Api.h.html">QMS_Api</a>
	Object. This also instantiates member 
	<a href="QMS_Supplier.h.html">supplier</a> and
	<a href="QMS_Consumer.h.html">consumer</a>
	objects. No connections to the event channel are established
	yet. 
      </li>
      <li>
	The client code then initializes the new QMS_Api object,
	feeding it the command line options, an ID number that
	identifies the type of entity that we are (a Desi entity that
	generates queries and consumes Remos data, or Remos
	instrumentation that consumes queries and creates data events.
	This causes the library to initialize and bind to the ORB,
	POA, the event channel, and the scheduler; though no
	connections to the event channel are established yet. The
	following tasks are accomplished:
	<ol type="1" compact="compact">
	  <li> ORB initialization. </li>
	  <li>Getting a handle for the Portable Object Adapter</li>
	  <li>Getting a handle for the POA manager, used later to
	    activate the servant for the consumer object</li>
	  <li>Obtain a reference to the naming service. This is the
	    first connection made outside the process</li>
	  <li>Obtain a handle for the real time scheduler, used later
	    by the consumer object</li>
	  <li>Obtain a handle for the event channel</li>
	  <li>All these handles are stashed, and passed along to the
	    consumer and supplier objects to be stashed there for later
	    use. </li>
	</ol>. 
      </li>
      <li>
	Next, the client code registers a call back with this newly
	created object, providing a function that should be called
	when the data arrives. On the Desi side, this call back
	function needs to handle the data that shall be returned by
	the Remos instrumentation, and the Remos instrumentation probe
	needs to provide a function that can handle queries sent to
	it. No connections to the event channel are established.
	<ol type="1" compact="compact">
	  <li>
	    This call back function is passed to the consumer object
	    to be used later while establishing a connection with the
	    event channel
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li>
	Then the client code calls a routine to connect the supplier
	to the event channel. This is used on the Desi side to
	establish the connection that shall send queries, and on the
	Remos instrumentation side to send back the data gathered by
	Remos. There are a number of steps the supplier object takes
	at this point:
	<ol type="1" compact="compact">
	  <li>
	    Set the scheduler information, including criticality and
	    importance of the events that shall be generated
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Set up the QoS information for the supplier, including the
	    supplier ID, the type of events that shall be generated,
	    and the scheduler information from the previous step.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Get a supplier admin object from the event channel
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Use this supplier admin to get a consumer proxy from the
	    event channel
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Connect out push supplier object to this consumer proxy
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li>
	The next step is to connect the consumer object to the event
	channel. This requires that a call back method already be
	registered, since the consumer needs to be able to handle the
	events coming in from the event channel.  There are a number
	of steps the Consumer object takes 
	at this point:
	<ol type="1" compact="compact">
	  <li>
	    Set the scheduler information, including criticality and
	    importance of the events that shall shall be recieved
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Set up the QoS information for the consumer, including the
	    supplier ID, the type of events that shall be accepted,
	    and the scheduler information from the previous step. At
	    thsi point we add in all the event types we are interested
	    in listening to. 
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Get a consumer admin object from the event channel
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Use this consumer admin to get a supplier proxy from the
	    event channel
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li>
	This is where the behaviors of the Desi client and the Remos
	instrumentation client diverge. The Desi client fires up a
	thread that does the main task, and generates the queries and
	subsequently dispatches them to the Remos instrumentation
      </li>
      <li>
	The client applications then enter into an loop listening for
	CORBA events. This is where the final task of connecting the
	Consumer object to the event channel is done. 
      <li>
	Now we are in business. The Desi code can now call thesend
	method, and use the consumer proxy's push method to
	send the data off.
      </li>
      <li>
	The Remos instrumentation module then waits for an query event
	on the event channel. When it recieves an event, it Constructs
	the Remos query, and sends it to Remos. When data are
	available from Remos, the instrumentation module pushes the
	data out to the event channel
      </li>
      <li>
	The push consumer interface of the Desi-QMS entity recieves
	this data, and feeds it to the call back function that was
	registered with QMS. No manipulation of the data is done; any
	book keeping required would be the responsibility of the Desi
	client code.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	Please note that there is not necesarily a one to one
	relationship between the query event and the data events; a
	singel query may ask for a series of data events (perhaps
	recurring series of data events)
      </p>      
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Thankfully, since the network broker is not a C app, we shall
      not have to bother with <a href="c-bindings.html">C bindings</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 name="remos">Desi Remos specific Add ons for QMS</h2>
    
    <p>
      Most of the abive discussion actually utilizes a data agnostic,
      generic API, even though we used the Desi and Remos clients as
      examples (any QMS client shall go through similar steps).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      However, an add on utility class, 
      <a href="QMS_Remos_Msg.h.html">QMS_Remos_Msg</a>, is provided to
      help with the conversions back and forth between XML and the
      <a href="Remos_Datastructs.h.html">data structures</a> used in
      the client code to encapsulate a Remos 
      Query and response. The way this works is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>One creates a new QMS_Remos_Msg object</li>
      <li>One can then insert into it either
	<ol>
	  <li>A Remos Query struct</li>
	  <li>A Remos result struct</li>
	  <li>Well formed XML</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li>
	Subsequently, one can extract from the  message
	<ol>
	  <li>XML encoding of whatever was stuffed into the object</li>
	  <li>Recreate the  Query struct (if that is what was inserted
	    into the message object)</li>
	  <li>Recreate the result struct ((if that is what was inserted
	    into the message object)</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 name="refs">Data structs and Class Heirarchy</h3>
    <p>
      Most of this is implemented as these classes:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>An <a href="QMS_Api.h.html">object</a> encapsulating the
	interface with the client code</li>
      <li>An <a href="QMS_Consumer.h.html">object</a> implementing a
	push consumer interface with the event channel, and</li>
      <li>An <a href="QMS_Supplier.h.html">object</a> implementing a
	push supplier interface for the event channel.</li>
      <li>
	A <a href="QMS_Remos_Msg.h.html">object</a> that provides XML
	conversions to and from the data structs used by the client
	code</li>
    </ol>
    The file <a href="Remos_Datastructs.h.html">Remos_Datastructs.h</a> 
    contains the struct definitions used in this application.
